! There is nothing new in this final section that I haven't 
  done up until now. I will inderact with database, create 
  a migration, set up controllers and views. I have done all
  of these, nothing of these is unique or new. I just apply 
  what I have already done.

1. Create a new gallery with a title.
2. Upload images to a gallery.
3. Delete images from a gallery.
4. Update the title of a gallery.
5. View a gallery (so we can share it with others).
6. Delete a gallery.
7. View a list of galleries we are allowed to edit.


It is worth noting that some of these actions above will need
to be restricted (authorization).
So as I start building my controllers it might worth noting
that down.
For example if a user creates a new gallerie he should have
permission to upload or delete images or change the gallerie
title, but other people shouldn't be able to do that.
On the other hand when it comes to viewing a gallerie I might
want to make it so everybody can view the gallerie.


--- VIEWS ---
So this might give us the following views we need to create:
- Create a new gallery
- Edit a gallery
- View an existing gallery
- View a list of all of our galleries

these will be my pages:
new, edit, show, index    
(this is a common naming schema especially in MVC)


--- CONTROLLERS ---
I will also need controllers (aka HTTP handlers) to support these views:
- New and Create to render and process a new gallery form.
- Edit and Update to render and process a form to edit a gallery.
- Show to render a gallery.
- Delete to delete a gallery.
LATER
- An HTTP handler to process image uploads.
- An HTTP handler to remove images from a gallery.


--- MODELS ---
And finally, I need a way to persist data in my models package, and this will
need to support the following CRUD operations:
- Creating a gallery
- Updating a gallery
- Querying for a gallery by ID
- Querying for all galleries with a user ID
- Deleting a gallery
LATER
- Creating an image for a gallery.
- Deleting an image from a gallery.
