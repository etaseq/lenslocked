AUTHENTICATIN PROCESS IN THE APP

1. If new user -> Create the user in the database     -> return the user
   If old user -> Authenticate user with his password -> return the user

2. Use the user.ID to create a new session token. Hash the token and
   put it in the sessions table alongside the user.ID
   return the session

3. Take the session.Token (not TokenHash) and put it in a cookie.


MIDDLEWARE

1. Check if there is a cookie named CookieSession and if it exists retrieve
   its content which is the session.Token I have stored.

2. Hash the token and search the sessions table for the corresponding user.ID.

   return the user

4. Put the user in a new context
